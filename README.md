# Bikesharing in NYC

## Overview
This project analyzes data from CitiBike's NYC bikesharing program to highlight key user metrics. These visualizations can help investors see the data from a new perspective and make the decision to bring a similar bikeshare to Des Moines. 

First, we used Python and PANDAS to change the trip duration data into a datetime format. Then, we used Tableau Public to create a visual Story to show investors. 

## Results

## Summary 
Based on the data analysis and visualizations performed here, we can suggest the two following things for the Des Moines investor proposal: 

#### Bike Inventory and Timing
Due to bike use being heaviest during traditional commuting hours, bikes should be readily available during the 6am-9am window and from 4pm-7pm. However, as a Midwestern city, Des Moines likely has a larger percentage of suburban commuters who drive personal vehicles into the urban core where bike share docks would be located. This frees up the possibility to market the bikes during the lunch hour so workers can easily get around to restaurants or local parks to enjoy their lunch. 

#### Bike Dock Locations
Bikesharing stations should be easily accessible from the places where they are most likely to be used. This means that docks should be near large office buildings, hospitals, parks, and government buildings like City Hall. When bikesharing docks are easily found, the bikes are more likely to be returned and housed properly.
